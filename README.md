NodeJs VS PHP in asynchronous programming.

Asynchronous programming is a means of parallel programming in which a unit of work runs separately from the main application thread and notifies the calling thread of its completion, failure or progress.

NodeJs

1)Install dependencies Express, Ejs And Socket.io
2)Create a Main Index.js and render the chat.ejs file.

That's it. You've made a working Multi Chat App.

PHP

For PHP You'll have to use the following technologies and even handcode them sperately.
1)SQL(MYSQL Connection)
2)HTML, CSS and JS
3)PHP Backend

Winner: Nodejs.
Why? 1) Lesser code(About 30 lines max)
     2) Better performance(In terms of speed)
     3) Server load decreases with asynchronous code.
